# 🧬 AI-Powered Blood Classifier 💉

A powerful machine learning application that classifies blood samples for medical diagnostics and research. This model uses AI to predict and analyze blood characteristics, supporting efficient clinical decision-making.
This also achieves an accuracy of >95%

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predicts blood-related outcomes based on lab data or microscopy images
- 🧠 Uses cutting-edge ML/DL models (e.g., Random Forest, CNN, etc.)
- 📊 Provides visualization of predictions and performance
- 💾 Easily customizable and scalable for new datasets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib / Seaborn 📊
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch 🧠
- Jupyter Notebooks 📓
- Streamlit / Flask (optional UI) 🌐

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleans, normalizes, and augments data as needed.

2. **Model Training**  
   Trains ML or DL model(s) with optimized hyperparameters.

3. **Evaluation**  
   Generates classification report, confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.

4. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   Model can be deployed via Streamlit, Flask, or a REST API.
